Answer of the Question:
Few years back, the default branch after creating repository was "Master". But now github has made default name as "Main" to avoid racism as using master in programming is not for good.
But these are the same branches, you can always change the default branch according to your convenience. Today when we see Master branches as default in Github, is is because of the reasons that either the repo is old like 2-3 years old or the branch Master is intentionally made as default instead of Main that is in todays time created by default by Github.
